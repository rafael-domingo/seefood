Shazam for Food.

# Introduction
Inspired by HBO's Silicon Valley, this is an homage to Jian Yang's infamous SeeFood app. This one has more functionality and can detect up to 36 different kinds of food, including the all-important Hot Dog. 

Activate :hotdog: mode to experience the authentic recreation of Jian Yang's masterpiece. 

This app utilizes the Google Cloud Vision API to detect the presence of food in a user-submitted image. Images are stored on Cloudinary and the app's animations are powered by Framer Motion.
